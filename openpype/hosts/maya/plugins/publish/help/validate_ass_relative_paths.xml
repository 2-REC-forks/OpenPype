    <error id="project_not_in_texture">
<title>Project roots are not in texture search paths.</title>
<description>Project roots must be included in texture search paths to allow searching for textures published in
    that given project.

    ### How to repair
    Add project root to the paths. You can use environment variable that is automatically set by OpenPype on Maya
    launch. This variable has different names based on you project settings but it follows this convention:

    `OPENPYPE_PROJECT_ROOT_{NAME}` where `{NAME}` is the name of project root. If your project root is called
    `WORK` you can use it like this:

    ```
    [OPENPYPE_PROJECT_ROOT_WORK]:/my/custom/path
    ```
    You can set it in **Render Settings -> System -> Search Paths -> Texture Search Path**.
