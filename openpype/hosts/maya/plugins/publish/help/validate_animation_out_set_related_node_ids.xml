<title>Non-related IDs</title>
<description>All object in Animation `out_SET` must be related to each other. This validation makes sure there is no
    node under it (deformer for example) that is not related to other nodes. For instance {instance}, these nodes are
    invalid - not related: {nodes}.
</description>
<detail>
    When a deformer is applied in the scene on a referenced mesh that already had deformers then Maya will create a new shape node for the mesh that
    does not have the original id. This validator checks whether the ids are valid on all the shape nodes in the instance. We are ensuring that all
    nodes have a cbId and a related ID to the original shapes.
